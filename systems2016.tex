% question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of
% the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or
% treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main
% findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or
% interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation
% of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented
% and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the
% main conclusions.}
